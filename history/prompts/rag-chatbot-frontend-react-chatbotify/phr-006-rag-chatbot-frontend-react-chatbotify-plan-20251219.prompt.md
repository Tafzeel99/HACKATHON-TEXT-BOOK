# Plan RAG Chatbot Frontend with react-chatbotify

## Summary
Completed the implementation planning for the RAG Chatbot Frontend using react-chatbotify. The plan includes technical context, constitution check, project structure, research findings, data models, quickstart guide, and API contracts. All constitutional requirements were verified and passed.

## Key Decisions

- Integrate with Docusaurus via Root component for global availability
- Use Axios for API communication with RAG backend
- Implement stateless UI with no persistence as required
- Structure the implementation with proper TypeScript types and React best practices

## Outcomes
- Complete implementation plan in `specs/006-rag-chatbot-frontend-react-chatbotify/plan.md`
- Research document with technology decisions in `research.md`
- Data model specification in `data-model.md`
- Quickstart guide in `quickstart.md`
- API contracts in `contracts/rag-api-contract.md`
- Agent context updated with new technology stack
