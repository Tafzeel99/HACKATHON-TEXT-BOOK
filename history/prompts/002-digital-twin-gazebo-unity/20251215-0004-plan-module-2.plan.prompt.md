## Prompt

The user explicitly requested to proceed with /sp.plan command after previous /sp.specify command completion.

## Response snapshot

Completed planning for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), including generating research, data model, quickstart, and updating agent context.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the implementation plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity).
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests for planning phase.
- 📁 Files: Modified `specs/002-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/plan.md`, created `specs/002-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/research.md`, `specs/002-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/data-model.md`, `specs/002-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/quickstart.md`, and `specs/002-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/contracts` directory.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.tasks`.
- 🧠 Reflection: Manual creation of PHR due to `bash` command not being available in PowerShell environment for `run_shell_command`.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `run_shell_command` does not consistently execute `bash` scripts directly in a PowerShell environment, leading to `CommandNotFoundException`. This necessitates manual PHR creation.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement a PowerShell wrapper function within the agent that can execute bash scripts or rewrite the bash scripts in PowerShell.
