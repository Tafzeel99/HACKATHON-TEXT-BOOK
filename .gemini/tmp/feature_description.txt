Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)Target audience:- AI and Robotics students focusing on perception and autonomyFocus:- Advanced AI perception and training- Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data- Accelerated localization, mapping, and navigationModule Structure (2–3 Chapters):1. Perception & Training with NVIDIA Isaac Sim - Photorealistic simulation - Synthetic data pipelines - Interactive diagrams: perception → training → validation flow2. Accelerated Perception with Isaac ROS - Hardware-accelerated VSLAM - Sensor-to-navigation pipelines - Interactive diagrams: camera/LiDAR → VSLAM → localization3. Humanoid Navigation with Nav2 - Path planning for bipedal robots - Constraint-aware navigation - Interactive diagrams: map → planner → controller → motionSuccess Criteria:- Reader understands Isaac Sim’s role in AI training- Reader can explain accelerated VSLAM and navigation- Reader can interpret system-level robotics diagramsConstraints:- Format: Markdown (Docusaurus-compatible)- Diagrams: Interactive (Mermaid, SVG, or Docusaurus plugins)- Sources: Official NVIDIA Isaac and ROS 2 documentationNot Building:- GPU kernel optimization- Custom SLAM algorithm design- Hardware deployment guides- Full production navigation stacks
