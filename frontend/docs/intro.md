# Introduction: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course**! This textbook provides a practical guide to building intelligent robotic systems using an AI-native, spec-driven approach. You will learn to design, implement, and deploy robots that perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## Course Structure: Key Learning Modules

This course is structured into focused modules:

<div className="module-list">
*   **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Master the basics of ROS 2, Python agents, and URDF modeling for robotics.
*   **Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation**: Explore digital twins with Gazebo and Unity for robot simulation and sensor data.
*   **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**: Understand AI-driven robot architectures using NVIDIA Isaac™ for cognitive capabilities.
*   **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Integrate LLMs with robotics to enable natural language control for autonomous humanoids.
</div>

Each module offers essential concepts, architectural patterns, and practical implementation details. Engage with examples and code to maximize your learning.

Embark on your journey to develop the next generation of AI-powered physical intelligence!
