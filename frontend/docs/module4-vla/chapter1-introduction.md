# Chapter 1: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This chapter introduces the concept of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, focusing on the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Robotics. It sets the stage for understanding how natural language commands can be translated into complex robot behaviors.

## Key Concepts

*   **Definition of VLA**: What VLA systems are and their significance in robotics.
*   **LLMs in Robotics**: The role of LLMs in interpreting commands, cognitive planning, and decision-making for robots.
*   **Action Generation**: How high-level plans are translated into executable robot actions.
*   **Capstone Project Overview**: A brief introduction to the Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project.
