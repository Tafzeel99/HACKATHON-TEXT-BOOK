# Chapter 5: Robot Navigation

This chapter focuses on the autonomous navigation capabilities of the robot, including path planning and obstacle avoidance within a simulated environment.

## Key Concepts

*   **Path Planning**: Algorithms and strategies for generating collision-free paths.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance**: Mechanisms for detecting and reacting to static and dynamic obstacles.
*   **ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2)**: Conceptual integration with standard ROS 2 navigation tools.
*   **Environmental Understanding**: How the robot uses sensor data (e.g., lidar, odometry) to build a map and localize itself.
