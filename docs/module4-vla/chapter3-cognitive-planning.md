# Chapter 3: Cognitive Planning with LLMs

This chapter explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged for cognitive planning, translating natural language commands into structured robot plans.

## Key Concepts

*   **LLM Role in Planning**: How LLMs interpret commands, understand context, and generate high-level action sequences.
*   **Plan Representation**: The structure of the cognitive plan (e.g., JSON format with abstract steps).
*   **ROS 2 `CognitivePlanning` Action**: Detailing the ROS 2 Action interface for LLM-driven planning.
*   **Object-Aware Planning**: Integrating object detection feedback into the planning process for more informed decisions.
